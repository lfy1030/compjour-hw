## Brief Notes

[Minna no Data](http://www.minnanods.net/) is a crowdsourciing site in Japan that gathers and display on their website a searchable database of measurements of radioactive substances in food products. The measurements are submitted by various local NGOs, NPOs and community volunteer groups from around Japan and checked and entered into the database by the website organizers.

The source does not include the category taxonomy as part of the data so this project focused on adding categories to the entries as well as adding visualizations

## Future Improvements

Plot.ly is quite slow in loading. Perhaps other libraries for making interactive maps can be explored. 

A database could be used for loading data. Right now everything is in json and it had to be broken up because the whole file is too large to render in the browser without Chrome freezing.
