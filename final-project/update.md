# Project Update

1.Data

To be honest, I haven't had time to start gleaning the data as I had other more urgent deadlines over the weekend. However, I did think over what I plan to do about the taxonomy issue. Since the data was already divided into html pages (e.g. the tables for say vegetables are listed on a page called category-vegetable.html), I can just tag the IDs based on which html file they were gleaned from. 

The same process can be performed for each type of category not tagged in the database (type of food, season, prefecture) and that will produce three separate csv files which can then be merged together since each entry is identifiable by a unique ID number. 

2.Libraries

I am planning to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to design the website. For the visualizations I intend to use plot.ly API for Python. For the sortable I'm planning to use this [Bootstrap](http://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn/) version. 

3.The mockup

[Here](https://moqups.com/lfy1030@gmail.com/5ypHPSnM) is how my mockup looks like.
